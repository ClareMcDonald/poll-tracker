## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
   drawing in notebook

2) **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
  1. Create poll div
    1. Option 1 input
    2. Option 2 input
    3. create form button
   2. current poll div
      1. div to display current question
      2. div to display option 1 count
      3. div to display option 2 count
      4. button to vote 1
      5. button to vote 2
      6. button to undo 1
      7. button to undo 2
   3. close poll button
   4. div to display past polls

3) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?** 
4) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
5) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
6) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
7) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
